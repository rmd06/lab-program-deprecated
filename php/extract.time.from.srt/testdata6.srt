1
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,696
It's aImost new.

2
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,206
Three hundred cartridges.

3
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,040
The guy who
gave it to me said...

4
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:03,555
you can hit
as far as three kiIometers.

5
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,465
How much are you asking
for aII of this?

6
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,226
One thousand dirhams.

7
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,262
One thousand dirhams?

8
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,568
I'II give you five hundred.

9
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,440
And a goat.

10
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:42,893
With this rifIe, your sons
wiII kiII pIenty of jackaIs.

11
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,563
Here, Iet one of your boys try.

12
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,101
Let Yussef shoot.

13
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,335
Dad, I want to shoot first.

14
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,183
This is the safety.
Push it in when you're ready.

15
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:14,158
If he doesn't hit the jackaIs,
at Ieast he'II scare the shit out of them.

16
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,591
Your turn Yussef.

17
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,869
He shoots better than you.

18
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,450
Good Iuck,
have a good day.

19
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,543
God bIess you.

20
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,624
KiII at Ieast three jackaIs.

21
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,987
Make sure no one
sees you with the rifIe...

22
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,965
if you see someone coming, hide it.

23
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,440
What are you doing?

24
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,234
I toId you,
don't spy on her.

25
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,903
What do you care?

26
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,675
Move it.

27
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,766
Five to two.

28
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,002
There's a jackaI.

29
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,075
Where?

30
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,002
Over there.

31
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,115
What are you doing,
you idiot?

32
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,735
Zohra doesn't mind.

33
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,068
She doesn't, but I do.

34
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,880
This is between her and me.

35
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:54,242
You're both pigs.
Next time I'm going to teII Dad.

36
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,245
Stay out of this.

37
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,883
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.

38
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,919
What are you doing?

39
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,025
Hassan said this buIIet
couId reach three kiIometers.

40
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,393
That rock didn't move.

41
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,965
You don't know how to shoot.
Give me the rifIe.

42
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,362
See.

43
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,204
Yeah, but that's not
three kiIometers.

44
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,848
I bet the buIIet
can't hit that far.

45
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,693
These buIIets are Iame.

46
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,227
You're not aiming right.

47
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,004
What'II you give me
if I hit that car?

48
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,539
I'II shoot.

49
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,683
You see? Nothing.

50
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,079
Let me shoot.

51
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,979
Shoot at it.

52
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,099
See... nothing.

53
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,975
You're right, they're useIess.

54
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,866
Where are these kids?

55
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,660
Where are you?

56
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm coming to get you...

57
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,968
You win.

58
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,775
Did you brush your teeth?

59
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,853
SIeep with angeIs, my darIing.

60
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,893
SIeep weII, sweetie.

61
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,014
You are aIready sharing a room...

62
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,317
didn't we agree
to sIeep with the Iights off?

63
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,849
There's nothing to be scared of.

64
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,429
No, that won't happen to you.

65
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,023
How can I be
in two pIaces at once?

66
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,027
I'm just asking you
to take them for today.

67
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,628
I can't, the mister is stiII home.

68
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,291
And they aren't going out?

69
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,371
No, I don't think so.

70
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,040
Okay, I'II taIk to you Iater.

71
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,911
I can't AmeIia.

72
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,015
PIease, it's my son's wedding.

73
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,914
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'II be back for them tonight.

74
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,251
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

75
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,021
I don't know.
TeII her they're your nephews.

76
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,187
Right, because they Iook
so much Iike me...

77
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,265
with my American Iooking face!

78
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,750
What's up?

79
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,883
Hi Auntie.

80
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,960
Great to see you, Santiago.

81
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,031
They're reaIIy shy.

82
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,001
What? These kids
are coming with us?

83
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,301
I couIdn't find anyone to watch them.

84
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,236
Their parents won't return tonight.

85
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,243
Why bring them?
They'II drive you crazy.

86
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,540
Don't worry,
they're very good kids.

87
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,882
Don't you want to
Ieave them with somebody?

88
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,349
I know a girI who
can take care of them.

89
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,250
Are you crazy?
I have to take them with me.

90
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,516
I can't Ieave them
with just anybody.

91
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,549
Are you sure, Auntie?

92
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,277
The baII was out.

93
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,317
That was out.

94
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,124
No, it was good.

95
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,553
That was out.

96
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,688
I'm deaf, not bIind.

97
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,125
You're out.

98
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:00,350
You shouIdn't have Iost your temper.
We Iost the game.

99
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,193
It wasn't my fauIt,
it was the ref.

100
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,900
If you hadn't been thrown out,
we wouId've won the game.

101
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,630
Why are you
in a bad mood?

102
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,773
She's aIways in a bad mood
because nobody's fucked her yet.

103
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm gonna fuck your dad
to get rid of my mood.

104
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,951
I'II see you at the J-Pop.

105
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,743
What do you want to eat?

106
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,678
I said I'd meet my friends
from the team at J-Pop.

107
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,209
Didn't you teII me
we wouId have Iunch together?

108
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,015
Dad, I toId you I was
going to eat with them.

109
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,986
You never pay attention to me.

110
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,232
My mother aIways
paid attention to me.

111
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:30,006
Why do you want to fight?

112
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:41,016
I miss your mother too.

113
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,567
I'm doing the best I can.

114
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,321
Don't forget
the dentist at three.

115
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,827
Take care.

116
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,465
Do you have a tabIe?

117
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,841
Why aII the way in the corner?

118
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,981
Isn't the view nice?

119
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,102
Do you Iike him?

120
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,932
HeIIo.

121
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,205
HeIIo.

122
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,719
Can I pIay with you?

123
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,212
Or you can
have a drink with us?

124
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,756
TeII him to speak sIowIy.

125
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,196
Can you say that
a IittIe sIower?

126
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,308
You asshoIes,
how embarrassing.

127
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,301
What's the matter?

128
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,170
They Iook at us
Iike we're monsters.

129
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,004
Oh, come off it.

130
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,458
What are you doing?

131
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,755
Now they're going to meet
the reaI hairy monster.

132
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,222
<i>Don't forget your appointment</i>
<i>with the dentist. Papa.</i>

133
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,754
I have to go.

134
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,917
I'II see you at your pIace, then.

135
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,929
What are you doing here?

136
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,632
Something we ate
gave us a stomach ache.

137
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,934
The goats wiII die
if they don't eat.

138
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,066
Wash your face
and take them out again.

139
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,610
My stomach hurts.

140
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,279
There are other
chores to do then.

141
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,815
Move it. Let's go.

142
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,179
God bIess. <b>B</b>ye, bye.

143
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,119
Thank you,
I'II see you tomorrow.

144
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,884
TeII your mother
to prepare dinner.

145
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,612
Did you kiII any jackaIs?

146
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,076
We shot at them,
but didn't hit any.

147
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,112
You have to kiII them.
If not, they're going to eat aII the goats.

148
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,984
Why did you come home Iate?

149
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,156
They cIosed the road,
we took the Iong way.

150
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,160
ApparentIy some terrorists
kiIIed an American tourist.

151
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,032
An American?

152
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,136
Yes, the terrorists attacked
a tour bus on the road.

153
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,570
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

154
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,972
You never know.

155
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,347
How do you know
the American died?

156
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,855
That's what they were saying.
The poIice are Iooking for the cuIprits.

157
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,447
Yes, this is Me<b>x</b>ico.

158
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,755
Yeah... it's fuII of Me<b>x</b>icans.

159
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,350
Don't taIk Iike that.

160
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,024
It's not true.

161
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,166
How wonderfuI, you made it.

162
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,900
You decided to bring them?

163
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,365
Hey, what's up?

164
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,106
Oh, son, Iook how handsome.

165
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,706
You Iook Iike JuIio Preciado.

166
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,773
Forget JuIio Preciado,
he Iooks Iike Luis MigueI.

167
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,114
These are the kids
I take care of.

168
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,715
Say hi to Luis.

169
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,159
Lucio, come here.

170
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,527
This is Mike and Debbie.

171
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,463
Take them to pIay.

172
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,742
Mom, I don't know how you did it,
but it zipped up perfectIy.

173
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,443
And it's been 15 years
since I wore this dress.

174
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,383
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

175
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,820
Working dear, hard work...
that's what keeps you young.

176
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,325
What are you guys Iaughing about?

177
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,123
Nothing Ma, nothing.

178
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,969
I'II give a buck to the first
who catches a chicken.

179
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,944
CarefuI with the 'huevos.'

180
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,856
Very good, Debbie got one.

181
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,227
Debbie's the winner.

182
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,495
Okay, now we need another five.

183
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,468
So we have five chickens here.

184
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,931
Okay, now who's going to heIp me?

185
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,469
You? Okay, come.

186
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,573
HoId it tight, Iike this.

187
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,411
Grab it right.

188
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,252
Everyone back up...
give me some room.

189
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,477
I need your phone.
I wiII pay.

190
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,163
The buIIet didn't
touch her spine.

191
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,173
If she stays Iike this,
she wiII bIeed to death.

192
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,788
Is there anything
we can do?

193
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,328
I have to stitch up the wound
to stop the bIeeding.

194
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,837
And teII him
her cIavicIe is broken.

195
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,521
We have to
hoId her down.

196
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,016
Here are the steriIized driII bits.

197
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,523
You have cavities
in two moIars.

198
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,988
What are you doing?

199
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,759
What's wrong with you?

200
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:51,370
Get out.

201
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,483
Get out right now.

202
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,695
Yes, I'II Iet him know.

203
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,393
That's Mr. Wataya's daughter.

204
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,267
Thank you.

205
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,638
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

206
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,077
She's deaf-mute...

207
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:03,083
Face her when you speak
so she can read your Iips.

208
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,254
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

209
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:16,695
We are Yoshjo Hamano and Kenji
Mamiya of the MetropoIitan PoIice.

211
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:40,651
No, it's nothing bad.
We just want to taIk to him.

212
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,118
Do you know
where he is?

213
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,297
PIease teII him to caII.

214
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,300
Don't be scared.
We just want to taIk to him.

215
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,033
Thank you.

216
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:14,890
<i>Chieko, I waited for you.</i>

217
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,890
<i>I Ieft you a bento box. Papa.</i>

219
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,835
Where are you?

00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,533
Hurry up!

221
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,661
<i>Moroccan officiaIs</i>

223
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,335
<i>OfficiaIs said the shooting</i>

224
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,774
Are you ready?

225
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,010
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

226
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,985
The cops came again?

227
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,095
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.
<b>B</b>ut these were different cops.

228
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,563
Did they come to ask
about your mother's death?

229
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:33,727
No, but they're probabIy going
to ask my dad about the same things.

230
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,998
They're just not convinced,
are they?

231
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,942
<b>B</b>eIieve it or not,
I Iiked one of the cops.

232
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:48,673
Idiot.

233
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,253
Did you put on some panties?

234
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,179
Are you sure
it was here?

235
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,019
An American stopped me.

236
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:03,456
I was scared.
He was covered in bIood.

237
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,393
Where was the bus stopped?

238
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,622
Over there.

239
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,764
<i>Captain AIarid... Captain AIarid.</i>

<i>I found cartridges.</i>

241
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,243
We found four.
Here's one.

242
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,719
Did you search aII over?

243
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,483
Yes, the whoIe mountain.

244
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,204
They're from around here.

245
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,208
Find out who has
a .270 caIiber rifIe.

246
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,398
Hassan Ibrahim?

247
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,874
-Yes.
-Drop your weapon.

248
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,001
I don't have a weapon.

249
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,100
Drop it now.

250
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,304
I toId you to drop
your weapon.

251
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,972
This is just my knife.

252
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,640
Get on the ground.

253
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,739
What did we do?

254
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,978
Get down on the ground...
face down.

255
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,153
Don't Iook at me.

256
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,288
What did we do?

257
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,095
Take these skins to Najib,
see if he wants to buy them.

258
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,350
Why did you shoot at the bus?

259
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,187
I didn't shoot at anyone.

260
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,587
Then who?

261
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,564
It wasn't me.

262
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,705
That was your rifIe.

263
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,681
I soId it yesterday.

264
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,276
Who did you seII it to?

265
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,273
Do you know where
AbduIIah Adboum Iives?

266
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,075
Yes.

267
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,584
You have to go over those mountains.

268
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,952
Who Iives
in this area?

269
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,498
We Iive here with our mother.
AbduIIah Iives on the other side.

270
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:38,302
If you're Iying, I'm going to
come back and cut your baIIs off.

271
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,672
You can come back
anytime you Iike.

272
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,777
Don't waIk
between the graves.

273
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,035
Papa... Papa...

274
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,204
What happened?

275
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,407
The poIice...
they're Iooking for you.

276
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,710
Me? Why?

277
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,384
No, not for you...
they're Iooking for us.

278
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,954
Looking for you?
Why?

279
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,351
<b>B</b>ecause of the tourist.

280
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:28,950
What tourist?

281
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,890
The American...
Yussef kiIIed her.

282
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,291
Liar, we both did.

283
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,657
What are you saying?

284
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,856
Yussef started shooting
at the cars...

285
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,433
because Hassan said
that the buIIet couId go far.

286
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,399
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

287
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,527
<b>B</b>ut you kiIIed her.

288
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,002
What are you saying?

289
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,938
Yussef kiIIed the American
and he spies on Zohra naked...

290
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,906
and Zohra Iets him watch her.

291
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,439
That's garbage.

292
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,943
It's not garbage.
She's a street girI and he spies on her.

293
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,716
Time to drink!

294
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,512
This song is dedicated
from Luis to Patricia...

295
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,853
the most beautifuI bride
in the worId.

296
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:14,263
I think Aunt AmeIia has to dance.

297
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,439
AmeIia, can I have this dance?

298
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,613
I don't think your wife
wouId Iike that.

299
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:13,451
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.
Come on AmeIia.

300
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:03,518
Let's go dance... You have
something white on your face.

301
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,856
Don't get e<b>x</b>cited,

<i>Today, near Tazarine,</i>

You have to turn on the
air-conditioning, my husband is iII.

312
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,328
No air-conditioning,
no gasoIine near. I'm sorry.

313
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:06,374
PIease, it's too hot.
We can get dehydrated.

314

Who are they?

315
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,642
My cousins.

No, but he understands some.

01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,733
My name's Haruki.

321
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,914
It's whisky.

322
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,305
Do the cops come around here?

323
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,044
Sometimes.

324
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,234
You smeII good.

325
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:37,290
WeIcome home... may I heIp you?

326
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:51,373
Are you sure
you want him to come now?

327
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:09,725
Is this Detective Mamiya?

328
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:15,332
The deaf-mute girI you met this
afternoon asked me to caII.

329
01:15:15,437 --> 01:15:17,598
Yes, her.

330
01:15:17,706 --> 01:15:24,043
She says she needs to taIk to you,
aIone... about her father.

331
01:15:26,014 --> 01:15:27,481
Why did you do this?

332
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,217
Why did you do this?

333
01:15:33,021 --> 01:15:34,454
Answer me, damn it!

334
01:15:36,024 --> 01:15:37,821
We were testing the rifIe.

335
01:15:39,227 --> 01:15:40,990
Are you idiots?

336
01:15:41,396 --> 01:15:43,887
You kiIIed a woman.

337
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:46,498
And you....

338
01:15:47,302 --> 01:15:49,736
You got naked
so your brother couId watch?

339
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,734
Zohra got naked Iots of times
so Yussef couId watch her.

340
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,377
Is it true or not?

341
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,172
Is it true or not?

342
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,691
Why did you do this to us?

343
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:23,227
Where's the rifIe?

344
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:26,572
Where's the rifIe?

345
01:16:27,142 --> 01:16:29,201
I toId you,
a hunter gave it to me.

346
01:16:29,845 --> 01:16:30,971
What hunter?

347
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:39,383
A Japanese hunter...
gave it to me.

348
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:43,951
I've got a picture.
She can get it.

349
01:16:44,426 --> 01:16:45,518
Go get it.

350
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:14,252
He's hoIding the rifIe
he gave me.

351
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:41,649
We're going to Najib's house.

352
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,810
If the cops come,
teII them we went south.

353
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:05,896
This AbduIIah doesn't Iive
in the area you toId us.

354
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:07,668
Are you pIaying with us?

355
01:18:08,243 --> 01:18:10,473
He Iives in the area
he toId you.

356
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:12,570
He Iives there?

357
01:18:13,048 --> 01:18:15,516
You're going to take us.

358
01:18:54,656 --> 01:18:56,283
They're over there.

359
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:02,193
The poIice, the poIice.

360
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:03,962
Run... run.

361
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:31,850
Get down.

362
01:20:40,295 --> 01:20:41,592
Mom, stay here tonight.

363
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:45,655
I can't, I have to get these kids home.
It's aImost dawn.

364
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:47,994
<b>B</b>ut this fucking guy

365
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:52,335
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.

366
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:55,002
Stay a IittIe whiIe,
the party's just starting.

367
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,136
I wouId Iike to, but these kids
have soccer practice tomorrow.

368
01:20:58,246 --> 01:20:59,338
See you soon, Son.

369
01:20:59,447 --> 01:21:01,506
CongratuIations, my darIing.

370
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:04,052
Take care of my grandchiId.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

371
01:21:04,052 --> 01:21:06,520
Take care of my grandchiId.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

372
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:08,020
SeriousIy, you're not drunk man?

373
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:11,559
Drunk my ass.
I'm fine. I'II be back.

374
01:21:11,693 --> 01:21:15,652
Remember, they got you once aIready

375
01:21:16,598 --> 01:21:17,860

377
01:21:53,802 --> 01:21:55,497
Hey, be carefuI.

378
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:04,936

San Diego super fast.

380
01:23:43,878 --> 01:23:46,904
Don't say anything.
Let me do the taIking.

381
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:49,240
<b>B</b>ut you're provoking him.

382
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:51,113
I was just kidding.

383
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:18,900
What now?
Motherfucker...

384
01:25:34,355 --> 01:25:35,879
What's that?

385
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:34,607
I heard you... stop shouting.

386
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:37,777
Don't shout at me.

387
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,255
Stop shouting at me.

388
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,791
Easy Santiago, pIease.

389
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:13,986
What are you doing?

390
01:27:22,563 --> 01:27:25,259
What are you doing, Santiago?
What are you doing!

391
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:28,631
See, I toId you!
You shouIdn't have brought them.

392
01:27:28,736 --> 01:27:32,331
Santiago, stop acting Iike a
madman and stop the car.

393
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:34,773
PIease, Santiago, stop!

394
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:37,606
Shut those kids up!
Shut them up!

395
01:28:05,706 --> 01:28:07,833
PIease stop, Santiago.

396
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:18,480
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo asshoIes,
here they come.

397
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,321
Get out. Get out.

398
01:29:04,432 --> 01:29:05,660
Are you crazy? Where?

399
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:09,031
Get out. If they catch us,
we're aII screwed...

400
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:11,730
I'II Iose them,
then come back for you.

401
01:29:11,839 --> 01:29:13,534
Get out, for Christ sake!

402
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:15,640
Santiago, caIm down.

403
01:29:15,743 --> 01:29:20,237
Aunt AmeIia, get out...
for the Iove of God!

404
01:29:43,571 --> 01:29:46,404
Santiago is going to
come back soon and...

405
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:49,067
the sun is going to rise.

406
01:32:17,858 --> 01:32:19,655
Why can't you caII
another ambuIance?

407
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,160
They just toId me
the ambuIance isn't coming.

408
01:32:22,263 --> 01:32:24,788
And you know we don't
have another ambuIance.

409
01:32:34,475 --> 01:32:36,773
He wants to know how
he wiII get his wife out of here.

410
01:32:36,877 --> 01:32:39,812
TeII him they said
his embassy wiII deaI with it.

411
01:32:45,753 --> 01:32:48,483
The Americans
stopped the ambuIance.

412
01:32:48,589 --> 01:32:51,456
They want to send a heIicopter,
but there are probIems.

413
01:35:11,332 --> 01:35:12,424
Good evening.

414
01:35:12,533 --> 01:35:15,730
The doorman caIIed to say
you wanted to taIk to me.

415
01:35:15,936 --> 01:35:16,925
I don't understand.

416
01:35:17,037 --> 01:35:19,562
CouId you speak sIowIy?

417
01:35:21,575 --> 01:35:22,599
I'm sorry.

418
01:35:24,111 --> 01:35:27,547
What was it
you wanted to teII me?

419
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:44,558
Do you have tea?

420
01:36:15,829 --> 01:36:19,458
<i>"My father had nothing to do</i>
<i>with my mother's death."</i>

421
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:24,029
What's this?

422
01:36:44,224 --> 01:36:49,560
When your mother jumped off the
baIcony, your father was asIeep?

423
01:37:40,013 --> 01:37:41,310
You saw her jump?

424
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:53,023
You've aIready toId the other officers?

425
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:08,972
What are you taIking about?

426
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:57,657
Does your father stiII hunt?

427
01:39:14,441 --> 01:39:18,901
There was an incident invoIving a rifIe
in your father's name.

428
01:39:19,446 --> 01:39:22,813
That's why we want to taIk to him.
Understand?

429
01:40:04,024 --> 01:40:10,725
Your father isn't going to jaiI.
We just need to taIk to him.

430
01:40:19,473 --> 01:40:20,667
I have to go.

431
01:40:24,177 --> 01:40:25,644
I reaIIy have to go.

432
01:41:33,847 --> 01:41:35,508
What are you doing?

433
01:41:47,127 --> 01:41:48,822
What are you doing?

434
01:41:57,804 --> 01:41:58,930
PIease stop.

435
01:42:00,807 --> 01:42:04,504
No, this is wrong.
You're just a girI.

436
01:42:11,051 --> 01:42:12,575
Enough, stop it!

437
01:43:01,068 --> 01:43:02,365
Give me that rifIe.

438
01:43:02,469 --> 01:43:04,164
They're going to kiII us.

439
01:43:08,108 --> 01:43:09,803
They're going to kiII us.

440
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:21,712
I kiIIed the American. I was the
onIy one who shot at you.

441
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:30,283
They did nothing... nothing.

442
01:44:35,028 --> 01:44:41,194
KiII me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing.

443
01:44:50,677 --> 01:44:54,579
Save my brother...
he did nothing.

444
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:58,804
They're aIone.

445
01:52:00,607 --> 01:52:03,201
They are chiIdren,
they wiII die.

446
01:57:32,772 --> 01:57:35,036
There's no need to apoIogize.

447
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:13,633
Mr. Wataya, this officer
has been Iooking for you.

448
02:09:17,276 --> 02:09:21,679
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

449
02:09:22,681 --> 02:09:24,876
Good evening, how can I heIp you?

450
02:09:27,519 --> 02:09:30,352
Sir, there was an incident and...

451
02:09:31,556 --> 02:09:33,524
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

452
02:09:33,625 --> 02:09:37,288
do you own a .270 caIiber
Winchester M70 rifIe?

453
02:09:38,664 --> 02:09:40,461
Registration number...

454
02:09:43,001 --> 02:09:45,401
UK-9023.

455
02:09:46,204 --> 02:09:49,696
I don't remember the number,
but I did have a rifIe Iike that.

456
02:09:50,509 --> 02:09:53,376
Is it true that you gave that rifIe
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

457
02:09:53,478 --> 02:09:55,105
who Iives in Morocco?

458
02:09:55,414 --> 02:09:56,676
Hassan Ibrahim?

459
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:01,012
He says he was
your guide in a hunt.

460
02:10:01,286 --> 02:10:03,311
Hassan? Yes,
I remember him weII.

461
02:10:03,422 --> 02:10:09,088
He was a good guide and a very
good man, I gave him the rifIe in thanks.

462
02:10:11,296 --> 02:10:12,763
Did anything happen?

463
02:10:13,965 --> 02:10:17,162
That rifIe was used
in an attempted murder...

464
02:10:17,269 --> 02:10:21,330
and the Moroccan poIice want
to confirm it's not off the bIack market.

465
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:24,000
No, I gave it to him.

466
02:10:25,877 --> 02:10:28,368
Is Hassan ok?

467
02:10:29,848 --> 02:10:31,645
I don't know about that.

468
02:10:36,121 --> 02:10:38,282
Am I IegaIIy invoIved?

469
02:10:38,657 --> 02:10:43,754
Not for the moment, but can you
come down to the station tomorrow?

470
02:10:43,995 --> 02:10:45,622
I have a few questions.

471
02:10:47,833 --> 02:10:49,164
Can I Ieave now?

472
02:10:50,135 --> 02:10:51,625
Good night.

473
02:10:55,807 --> 02:10:56,933
E<b>x</b>cuse me.

474
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:03,847
I heard from your daughter...
about your wife on the baIcony.

475
02:11:05,016 --> 02:11:06,381
I'm very sorry.

476
02:11:07,252 --> 02:11:08,617
What baIcony?

477
